The code powering [LGTM.in](http://lgtm.in/)

What
----

LGTM is the most popular comment on Github, perhaps. But LGTM is boring. So we spice it up with some images.

Why
----

Crafting images and picking them works fine on a leisurely day, but at crunch time, it helps to crowdsource your LGTMs.

Running
-------

* Checkout code.
* Install gradle
* Run

```bash
gradle appengineRun
```

Contributing
----

* Send a Pull Request.
* Check status on Travis (link below).
* Wait for any reviewers to *LGTM* your code. (Very meta)
* Wait for your code to be merged.
